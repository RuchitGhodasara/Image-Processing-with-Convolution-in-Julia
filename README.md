# Image-Processing-with-Convolution-in-Julia

### Language: Julia

In our Signal and Systems, semester 3, we did our final project about use of convolution in the image processing. We used Julia language and presented work on Pluto environment. We were group of 3 and I managed to understand the topic and wrote a code on Julia, also prepared a PPT; all of these I am putting here.

#### Applications
We showed how to detect an edge from image, a significant intermediate step for computer vision, along with elementary operations like making image blur and sharp.

We acknowledge Grant Sanderson and Julia Development community for their tutorials and libraries freely available on platforms like YouTube and GitHub.
